Information about legal prerequisites

The original design of the pigs belong to AngryBirds and Rovio Entertainment Ltd.
I did the 3d-models of the pigs for educational purposes.

Textures, that I did not create by myself come from cgtextures.com.

Fonts can be found on dafont.com.

I did all models by myself.

I also used the True Explosions Pack from the Unity-Asset-Store.
